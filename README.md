# Image Viewer

I designed this simple program in my fourth semester of college in preparation for an assessment. 
It allows the user to select any .jpg or .png file on their system and view it in a window. 
The user can view the image files' details or do a number of things to alter the image, such as 
adjusting the hue, saturation, or brightness.
